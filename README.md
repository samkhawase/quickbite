quickbite
=========

Grab a Quickbite using Openstreetmap API 

The iOS app is like a thin client which fetches the data from the server and shows it on the screen as a list. It's a simple Master-Detail App and uses MapKit to load the map of the location. It has caching facility with CoreData but it's not completely functional (radius search needs work). 

I'm planning to experiment with the new GeoFencing API to improve results. Also in the plans is a way to rate and comment on a place and take notes. 

The App pulls data from OpenMapquest API and uses reverseGeo coding to get location address, until the backend flask app is ready.
